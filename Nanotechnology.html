      <h2>What is Nanotechnology?</h2>
        <p class="inline">
          Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on a near-atomic scale to
          produce new structures, materials and devices. The technology promises
          scientific advancement in many sectors such as medicine, consumer
          products, energy, materials and manufacturing.
        </p>
        <p class="inline">
          Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at
          the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers. Physicist Richard
          Feynman, the father of nanotechnology. Nanoscience and nanotechnology
          are the study and application of extremely small things and can be
          used across all the other science fields, such as chemistry, biology,
          physics, materials science, and engineering.
        </p>
        <h2>How it Started?</h2>
        <p class="inline">
          The term "nanotechnology" was not coined until 1974 by researcher
          Norio Taniguchi, who used it to describe precision machining at the
          nanoscale.The concept of nanotechnology, the study and manipulation of
          matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale, can be
          traced back to a talk given by physicist Richard Feynman in 1959. He
          discussed the possibility of manipulating and arranging individual
          atoms and molecules to create new materials and devices.
        </p>
        <p class="inline">
          In the 1980s, the development of the scanning tunneling microscope
          (STM) and the atomic force microscope (AFM) allowed scientists to
          visualize and manipulate individual atoms and molecules, opening up
          new possibilities for nanoscale research.
        </p>
        <h2>Applications of Nanotechnology</h2>
        <p class="inline">
          Nanotechnology is a rapidly growing field with a wide range of
          potential applications. One of the most promising areas of application
          is in the field of medicine, where nanotechnology is being used to
          develop new diagnostic and therapeutic tools. For example,
          nanoparticles can be engineered to target specific cells or tissues in
          the body, allowing for more precise drug delivery and reducing side
          effects. Nanoparticles can also be used to develop new imaging
          techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed
          tomography (CT), which can provide higher resolution and more detailed
          images of the body.
        </p>
        <p class="inline">
          Another area of application for nanotechnology is in the field of
          electronics, where nanoscale materials and devices are being developed
          to create faster, more efficient, and more powerful devices. For
          example, nanoscale transistors can be used to create faster and more
          energy-efficient computer processors, while nanoscale memory devices
          can provide higher storage capacity in smaller form factors. Nanoscale
          materials are also being used to create new types of sensors and
          displays, which can provide more accurate and detailed information
          about the world around us.
        </p>
        <p class="inline">
          Nanotechnology is also being used in the development of new materials
          with novel properties. For example, carbon nanotubes and graphene have
          unique mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, which make them
          attractive for a wide range of applications, from high-strength
          materials to flexible and transparent electronic devices. Other
          nanoscale materials, such as nanoparticles and nanofibers, can be used
          to create new types of coatings, filters, and catalysts, which can
          improve the performance of a wide range of products and processes.

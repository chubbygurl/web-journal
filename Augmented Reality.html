        <h2>OVERVIEW OF AUGMENTED REALITY</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Technology that combines virtual information with the real world.</li>
          <li>It uses Multimedia, 3d Modeling, real-time tracking and registration, Intelligent interaction, sensing and more.</li>
          <li>Applies computer-generated virtual information such as text, image, video, etc. to the real world after simulation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>DIGITAL REALITY</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Digital reality refers to the wide spectrum of technologies and affordances that include Augmented
            Reality, Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality that simulate reality in various ways.</li>
          <li>Emerging immersive technologies that are able to create a totally artificial virtual environment through computer generated contents.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>VIRTUAL REALITY</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A combination of real scene viewed by a user
            and virtual scene generated by a computer that
            augments the scene with an additional
            information.</li>
          <li>An enhanced version of the real physical world
            that is achieved through the use of digital visual
            elements, sound, or other sensory stimuli and
            delivered via technology.</li>
          <li>Virtual reality means feeling the
            imaginary(virtual world) world, rather than the
            real one. The imaginary world is a simulation
            running in a computer.</li>
          <li>Virtual reality is the term used for computer
            generated 3D environments that allow the user
            to enter and interact with alternate realities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>AUGMENTED REALITY</h2>
        <p class="indent">A combination of real scene viewed by a user
          and virtual scene generated by a computer that
          augments the scene with an additional
          information.</p>
        <p class="indent">An enhanced version of the real physical world
          that is achieved through the use of digital visual
          elements, sound, or other sensory stimuli and
          delivered via technology.</p>
        <h2>MIXED REALITY</h2>
        <p class="indent">Mixed reality (MR) is an emergent technology that blends virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).

          These days, mixed reality describes environments in which real and virtual subjects and objects interact in real
          time — and in which you can interact with both real and virtual components. This requires a headset that has
          either a transparent lens or a camera, so that you can still see the real world. Note that the Windows Mixed
          Reality headset is a VR headset with a camera.</p>
          <h2>ARCHITECTURE OF AR SYSTEM</h2>
          <p class="indent">This Architecture comprised of all above components
            and interactive relationship between them helps to
            develop augmented reality working model:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>User</b>

              -The most essential part of augmented reality is its
              user. The user can be a student, doctor, employee. This
              user is responsible for creation of AR models.</li>
            <li><b>Interaction</b>

              -It is a process between device and user. The word
              itself consist of its meaning some action perform by one
              entity as result in creation or some action performed by
              other entity.</li>
            <li><b>Device</b>

              This component is responsible for creation, display
              and interaction of 3D models. The device can be portal
              or in static state. Example, mobile, computer, AR
              headsets etc.</li>
            <li><b>Virtual Content</b>

              The virtual content is nothing but the 3D model
              created or generated by the system or AR application.
              Virtual content is type of information that can be
              integrated in real world user’s environment. This Virtual
              content can be 3D models, texture, text, images etc.</li>
            <li><b>Tracking</b>

              This component is basically process which makes
              possible creation of AR models. Tracking is sort of
              algorithm which help to determine the device where to
              place or integrate the 3D model in real world
              environment. There are many types of Tracking
              algorithm available which can be used in development of
              AR applications.</li>
            <li><b>Real-life entity</b>

              The last component AR architecture is real world
              entities. This entities can be tree, book, fruits, computer
              or anything which is visible in screen. AR application
              does not change position of real life entity. It only
              integrate the digital information with this entities.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>APPLICATIONS OF AUGMENTED REALITY:</h2>
          <h3>AR in ENTERTAINMENT</h3>
          <p class="indent">Augmented reality can be used in various “entertainment” industries
            as entertainment covers quite a number of different industries –
            music, movies, live shows, games – and all of them can benefit from
            using augmented reality.</p>
          <p class="indent"><b>AR in games –</b> the AR games were praised for increasing physical
            activity in people – you actually have to move around to find your
            target, for example, Pokémon. At the same time, there are complaints
            that players could cause various incidents and accidents being too
            engrossed in the game. In any case, Pokémon GO has rightfully earned
            its popularity and opened the world of AR games to us.</p>
          <p class="indent"><b>AR in music –</b> music is not only about listening to favorite tracks and
            putting together playlists. When we like a piece, we often want to find
            out more about its background: the performers’ bios, the lyrics of the
            song, the making of the recording or the music video.</p>
          <p class="indent"><b>AR on TV –</b> this may seem a bit far-fetched, as television already
            shows a virtual world, thus adding augmented reality will raise it to
            the second power. However, some experiments of fusing augmented
            reality on TV are already being made with the promise of future
            enhancements. One way of integrating augmented reality in television
            is adding supplementary information to what is going on the TV
            screen – such as match scores,
            betting options, and the like.</p>
          <p class="indent"><b>AR in eSports –</b> recently, the industry of eSports has been gaining
            popularity in all parts of the globe. Competitive online gaming has
            become as fascinating as real sports, and the technology is following it
            closely with new solutions and unusual implementations.
            Augmented reality turns eSports shows into interactive experiences
            allowing the watchers to become participants.</p>
          <p class="indent"><b>AR in the theater –</b> in this sector, augmented reality can serve not
            only for entertainment purposes but also for the purposes of
            accessibility. The possibility to overlay virtual objects
            over the real environment can be used, for example, for subtitling in
            various theater shows.</p>

        <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
        <p class="indent">
          Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human
          intelligence in machines that are programmed to perform tasks that
          would typically require human intelligence, such as learning,
          problem-solving, and decision-making. AI has a long history, with
          roots dating back to the 1950s, but it has experienced a surge in
          popularity and development in recent years, driven by advances in
          computing power, data analysis, and machine learning algorithms.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          In the early days of AI, researchers focused on developing rule-based
          systems, which used pre-programmed rules and logic to solve problems.
          However, these systems had limitations and were not able to learn or
          adapt to new situations. In the 1980s, machine learning emerged as a
          new approach to AI, which focused on developing algorithms that could
          learn and improve based on experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Applications of Artificial Intellegence</h2>
        <p class="indent">
          Today, AI is being used in a wide range of applications, from virtual
          assistants like Siri and Alexa to autonomous vehicles and advanced
          robotics. Other examples of AI include image and speech recognition,
          natural language processing, and predictive analytics. Some of the
          most promising applications of AI include healthcare, where it is
          being used to diagnose and treat diseases, and manufacturing, where it
          is being used to improve efficiency and quality control. Despite its
          many benefits, AI also raises a number of ethical and societal
          concerns, particularly around issues of privacy, bias, and job
          displacement. As AI continues to advance and become more widespread,
          it will be important to carefully consider these issues and work to
          develop strategies for ensuring that AI is used in ways that benefit
          society as a whole.

        <h2>Examples of AI</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Virtual assistants: Virtual assistants like Apple's Siri,
            Amazon's Alexa, and Google Assistant use natural language processing
            (NLP) and machine learning to understand and respond to user
            requests and queries.
          </li>
          <li>
            Image and speech recognition: AI is used to recognize images and
            speech in a variety of applications, such as facial recognition for
            security systems and speech recognition for dictation software and
            virtual assistants.
          </li>
          <li>
            Autonomous vehicles: Self-driving cars use a combination of
            sensors, GPS, and AI algorithms to navigate roads and avoid
            obstacles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Healthcare: AI is being used in healthcare to analyze patient
            data and help diagnose and treat diseases more effectively. For
            example, AI algorithms can analyze medical images to detect
            cancerous tumors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Manufacturing: AI is being used to improve efficiency and quality
            control in manufacturing. For example, AI-powered robots can be used
            to perform tasks like assembling products and inspecting quality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finance: AI is being used in finance to analyze data and identify
            patterns and trends, which can help inform investment decisions and
            manage risk.
          </li>
        </ul>
